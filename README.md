# Synthesis in 1D

MATLAB implementation for signal synthesis. Currently working on 1D signal with 1st order scattering coefficients.

scattering_gabor_infreq_1d.m computes 1st order scattering coefficients.

gaborwave_synth_greedy_1d.m uses greedy algorithm to find a new signal that minimize the difference with original signal.

gabor_wave_gradient_infreq_1d.m is used for 'fminunc' function with gradient specified.
